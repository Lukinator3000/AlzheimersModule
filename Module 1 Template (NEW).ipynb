    "        * Contributes to: repeat statements and questions over and over, forget conversations, appointments or events, misplace items, often putting them in places that don't make sense, get lost in places they used to know well, forget the names of family members and everyday objects, have trouble finding the right words, expressing thoughts or having conversations.\n",
    "        * Concentrating is difficult for people with Alzheimer's, especially for long periods of time. Doing more than one task at once is especially hard. \n",
    "* Mid-stage symptoms: \n",
    "    * Changes in Personality and Behavior \n",
    "        * Brain changes can affect mood and behaviors: depression, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal, mood swings, not trusting others, anger or aggression, changes in sleeping habits, wandering, loss of inhibitions, and delusions, such as believing something has been stolen when it hasn't.\n",
    "* Late-stage symptoms: \n",
    "    * In the late stages of the disease, the symptoms become increasingly severe and can be distressing for the person with the condition, as well as their carers, friends and family.\n",

    "### Diagnosis\n",
    "* Doctors and healthcare experts mainly diagnose Alzheimer’s disease in patients by interrogating them on their dementia-like symptoms and by running a variety of examinations on their cognitive ability and body chemistry.\n",
    "    * Likely a traditional first step to diagnosing Alzheimer’s is noticing its symptoms, including mood changes, poor judgement, trouble doing daily tasks, and others mentioned above. In addition, a doctor, neurologist or geriatrician may also ask for more details about the patients’ symptoms and medical history to further evidence the Alzheimer's diagnosis and learn its potential cause. They may also interview the patient’s family members and close colleagues for more information about the patient’s condition.\n",
    "    * To gain confidence in the diagnosis, the health care team may run cognitive and physical examinations on their patients. Specialists can give patients mental status and/or neuropsychological tests to more objectively judge their memory and cognitive ability. Moreover, doctors can execute pre-established tests for other health issues like depression, Parkinson’s disease, or vitamin B-12 deficiency to double check that the cognitive symptoms don’t come from a different condition. Lastly, Alzheimer’s patients may be asked to go through brain imaging to check for brain degeneration that Alzheimer’s may cause; while brain scans can’t confirm Alzheimer’s diagnosis, they can still rule out more alternative diseases. More reliable diagnosis measures for Alzheimer’s are still being researched, including some that look into amyloid or tau-protein levels in blood and biomarkers like genes.\n",
    "* Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048075\n",
    "### Standard of care treatments (& reimbursement)\n",
    "* Treatments include drugs that regulate cognitive and behavioral symptoms (e.g. Galantamine, benzgalantamine, rivastigmine, and donepezil are cholinesterase). Other FDA-approved drugs like lecanemab and donanemab reduce beta-amyloid plaques in early Alzheimer’s stage to slow the cognitive decline (there’s also some insurance to cover the drug costs).\n",
    "* In moderate to severe cases, memamtine and other medications can be prescribed to regulate glutamate in the brain, reducing Alzheimer’s symptoms to allow patients to be able to do more ordinary tasks, like going to the bathroom independently.\n",
    "    * Dosage of such medications vary based on how well patients tolerate them, starting with low doses and gradually increasing if tolerated. They also have side effects, including nausea, vomiting, confusion, headaches, dizziness, loss of appetite, etc.\n",
    "    * Source: https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-treatment/how-alzheimers-disease-treated\n",
    "* Most of Alzheimer’s care can be paid for with Medicare primarily and other private health care insurance for those 65+ years old, at least for initial costs. Medicaid and long-term plans help cover Alzheimer’s expenses in the long term.\n",

    "### Disease progression & prognosis\n",
    "* General 5 stages of Alzheimer’s (generally lasts 3-20+ years)\n",
    "    1. Preclinical Alzheimer's:\n",
    "        * Stage long before noticeable symptoms, usually only identified in research settings, that can last for many years. Tau proteins (total Tau and phosphorylated Tau) aggregate into tangles within neurons, hindering their functioning, and Beta-amyloid plaques grow between synapses to disturb neuron communication. Patients start taking tests to see signs of Alzheimer’s risk, which include blood sample biomarkers, brain imaging, and genetic tests.\n",
    "    2. Mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's:\n",
    "        * Patients start having mild impairments in memory and thinking ability, such as memory lapses during conversation/events and trouble judging or planning tasks. Doesn’t have much effect on work or relationships.\n",
    "    3. Mild dementia due to Alzheimer's:\n",
    "        * This is when the patient shows difficulties doing daily tasks due to signs of dementia, mainly bad memory and/or cognitive capacity (possibly some personality changes to be more withdrawn or irritable). Alzheimer’s is likely to be diagnosed at this stage.\n",
    "    4. Moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's:\n",
    "        * The patient’s dementia worsens, amplifying the prior symptoms and calling for the need of a care person to help the patient do some daily activities. They also keep growing more irritable and unnecessarily suspicious about close ones.\n",
    "    5. Severe dementia due to Alzheimer's: \n",
    "        * Patient starts losing the ability to communicate and execute regular physical activities like walking, sitting, and eventually swallowing and bowel functioning.\n",
    "### Continuum of care providers\n",
    "1. Early Stage\n",
    "* For the Alzheimer’s patients in America, continuum of care starts with the diagnosis. The supportive care team usually includes a primary care physician or specialist, to provide medical & symptom knowledge and management, as well as a social worker from a nonprofit organization or community service, to assist in Alzheimer’s guidance, resources, and coping for the family.\n",
    "    * Specialists may include neurologists (oversee disorders in brain and nervous system), geriatricians (cares for older adults), geriatric psychiatrists (gives mental and emotional health care for older adults), neuropsychologists (specializes in standardized assessment of cognition and behavior, verbatim from gov source), speech and physical therapists (helps improve patients’ communication and activity abilities)\n",
    "2. Mid Stage\n",
    "* The Alzheimer’s symptoms start progressing, so patients start needing outside help for their everyday activities. Although family members may play the caregivers for the patients, other hired care services like visiting nurses and home health aides can assist in tasks like toileting, dressing, bathing, shopping, cooking, and light housekeeping for the Alzheimer’s patients. Caring family members may also hire short-term respite care to temporarily support the patients while the primary caregivers take a break (alzoc).Caregivers can also consider sending patients to Adult Day Care, which offers supervised physical and social activities as medical treatment and therapeutic recreation.\n",
    "3. Late Stage\n",
    "* By this phase, the symptoms of the Alzheimer's patient may make them no longer able to stay at home safely due to difficulty swallowing or other dementia-induced accidents. The supportive care team and/or close family members may transition the patient to hospice (end-of-life) care, nursing home, or other long-term residential facility to provide them 24/7 medical care and supervision.\n",

    "### Biological mechanisms (anatomy, organ physiology, cell & molecular physiology)\n",
    "* Alzheimer’s is a disease targeting the brain, namely its neuron cells that are key to its functionality. Neurons work through communication: a neuron receives cellular signals, in the form of neurotransmitter chemicals sent by other neurons binding to the receptors within the branch-like dendrites of the said neuron, that causes it to send an electric charge down through its cable-like axon neck and send out more neurotransmitters to signal other neurons in the in-between space, called synapses. This communication among millions of neurons, with the aid of consistent glucose sustenance, astrocyte and microglia support, and brain usage, eventually results in humans’ everyday cognitive abilities.\n",
    "* Alzheimer’s disease has multiple observed brain changes that may lead up to and cause the condition, such as…\n",
    "    * Beta-amyloid plaques: beta-amyloid is a protein that clumps in the brain around neurons, namely in-between neuron synapses that interferes with their cellular communication. Too much of these plaques, especially with beta-amyloid 42 form, can greatly hinder neuron functionality and cause cognitive decline.\n",
    "    * Tau tangles: tau is another protein that usually stabilizes microtubules in healthy neurons. In Alzheimer’s patients though, tau detaches from the microtubules and groups together to form neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons, perhaps spurred by overaccumulation of beta-amyloid plaques. These tangles then harm neurons by blocking their transport and communication systems from within.\n",
    "    * Connection Loss and Dysfunction: As neurons stop functioning properly, neuron connections and networks start falling apart, causing brain regions to shrink and cognitive ability to decline.\n",
    "    * Chronic Inflammation: initially-helpful glial cells that begin malfunctioning may induce inflammation in the brain due to lack of debris disposal and management.\n",
    "    * Vascular Issues: since the brain relies heavily on blood and the glucose it provides to keep neurons healthy and active, cardiovascular issues hindering that blood glucose supply may lead to brain inflammation and later neural connection breakdowns.\n",
    "* Source: https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease\n",
    "### Clinical Trials/next-gen therapies\n",
    "* Clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease have been going on to engineer future drugs and therapies that reduce patients’ symptoms and grant them more time to function independently without the need of a caregiver. Most of those developing drugs and therapies aim to fight against the main Alzheimer’s protein clumps, betaamyloid plaques and tau tangles, but other Alzheimer’s treatments like gene therapy are also being looked into.\n",
    "    * For example, lecanemab and donanemab drugs, recently approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the past few years, act as antibodies that neutralize betaamyloid proteins to prevent them from forming plaques. These drugs are estimated to give patients with mild symptoms several more months of independent living, specifically 8 additional months from donanemab or 10 additional months from lecanemab. \n",

    "## NOTES FROM YOUR TEAM: \n",
    "### Current Progress:\n",
    "9/9/25-9/11/25: In class, we did a lot of preliminary research and both caught each other up on how to push and pull files through GitHub. We established our shared files and folders for us to use throughout the project. We exchanged numbers and established a day to complete more research. Specifically, we divided up the work by Logan doing the first 5 bullet points, Luke doing the last 5, and both of us completing the 6th bullet point (or whoever gets to it first). We also brainstormed and selected a question to explore and analyze for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "9/14/25: We both completed more research and started to explore the data sets in more depth. We completed the work on our own, but checked in throughout the day to update each other about our progress and any questions we had. Completed 7 total bullet points and extracted the important information from the data sets (both Meta and Luminex). \n",
    "\n",
    "9/16/25: In class, we started coding and focusing on our question. We went line by line of the code given to us and made sure we both had a common understanding of what was being executed. Once we finished, we started editing the code to fit our project question. \n",
    "\n",
    "9/17/25: Texted about current project progress and established that we would like to finish all of our research bullet points by 9/18. We also discussed that we would both try to set up a bar graph fitting our data/question by Thursday's class. \n",
    "\n",
    "9/18/25: We learned more about data analysis through bar graphs in today's class and started doing more work for the code portions. After graphing out the Tau levels for each education level, however, Logan saw that the Tau score differences were not significant. Since we wanted a research topic that provided a stronger correlation, we switched our research question to \"Does betaamyloid 40 or 42 correlate to higher overall AD neuropathological change in patients?\" Logan again figured out the Python code and bar graph analysis of our new question and found a much more potent correlation, and Luke is writing this entry still confused on what an ANOVA is.\n",
    "\n",
    "9/19/25: Finished up all the Disease Background questions and more of the Data Analysis section. We also did some very minor Jupyter polishing to prepare for tonight's Second Jupyter Notebook Check-in submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "9/24/25: We met out of class during the evening to finalize our statistical data and graphs. We decided to frame our presentation in this way: contextual information using a scatterplot to show IF there is a correlation between amyloid beta 40 and 42 (example: if one decreases, does the other one also decrease?); using a violin plot (and bar graph to add simplicity) to show how concentrations decrease/increase across AD stages; finally, we will prove these findings with a 1 way ANOVA with p values. \n",
    "\n",
    "9/25/25: We confirmed our statistical tests and graphs with our TA (said they are a great way to go about the presentation). We went through the rubric and started adding the necessary content. Started working on data analysis, conclusions, and other implications (ethical and limitations). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code History\n",
    "We used Git and GitHub to work and collaborate on our Jupyter notebook. Here's the link to our GitHub page to look over the commit history of our code: https://github.com/Lukinator3000/AlzheimersModule\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra project questions we thought about: \n",
    "- Does brain pH affect how severe dementia is (in terms of Tau score, demetia diagnosis or age of death)?\n",
    "- Does presence of dementia correlate to severity in arteriolosclerosis?\n",
    "- Does betaamyloid 40 or 42 correlate to higher overall AD neoropathological change in patients? \n",
    "  - 9/18/25 UPDATE: This is now our new research question!\n",
    "- Does the highest level of education acheived by Alzheimer's patients affect their Tau score, both total and phosphorylated?\n",
    "  - 9/18/25 UPDATE: Scrapped this question for the one above it."

    "## QUESTIONS FOR YOUR TA: \n",
    "* First check-in: \n",
    "    - Just to make sure, how should we accurately cite the two datasets already given to us in Canvas?\n",
    "    - Should we care greatly about the grammar and overall diction of our Jupyter notes, or should we just focus on jotting down concise and readable notes for these sections?\n",
    "    - How should we cite the sources we used for the Disease Background section, and where should we put the citations?\n",
    "    - Is it ok if our question studies both tTau and pTau score, or should we only focus on one of them?\n",
    "    * Answers to questions:\n",
    "        - \"To answer the questions you have for me, you should cite the study the dataset was presented in. The jupyter notebooks do not have to be the most pristine code documentations for the check ins, though I would like to see a polished one at the end. I would like to be able to see what you've done each day (for future reference). For the citations in the disease background, it should be fine to put them as you have been with other sections. Your question is fine to study both pTau and tTau! I think its a great idea to do both if you can.\"\n",
    "* Second check-in:\n",
    "    - How much should we document our code? Should we add more in the data analysis Python code above, or is it sufficient enough?\n",
    "    - Did we pick the right kind of data analysis method, just to make sure?\n",
    "    - What recommendations would you suggest we make to improve our code, method, or bar graph display?"
