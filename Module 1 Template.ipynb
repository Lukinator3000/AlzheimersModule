    "        * Contributes to: repeat statements and questions over and over, forget conversations, appointments or events, misplace items, often putting them in places that don't make sense, get lost in places they used to know well, forget the names of family members and everyday objects, have trouble finding the right words, expressing thoughts or having conversations.\n",
    "        * Concentrating is difficult for people with Alzheimer's, especially for long periods of time. Doing more than one task at once is especially hard. \n",
    "* Mid-stage symptoms: \n",
    "    * Changes in Personality and Behavior \n",
    "        * Brain changes can affect mood and behaviors: depression, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal, mood swings, not trusting others, anger or aggression, changes in sleeping habits, wandering, loss of inhibitions, and delusions, such as believing something has been stolen when it hasn't.\n",
    "* Late-stage symptoms: \n",
    "    * In the late stages of the disease, the symptoms become increasingly severe and can be distressing for the person with the condition, as well as their carers, friends and family.\n",
    "        * Severe mood changes: be aggressive, such as hitting or shouting, become upset or restless, and call out or repeat the same question again and again\n",
    "        * Other signs include: difficulty eating and swallowing (dysphagia), unintentional passing of urine (urinary incontinence) or stools (bowel incontinence), difficulty changing position or moving around without assistance, and loss of speech. \n",

    "### Standard of care treatments (& reimbursement)\n",
    "* Treatments include drugs that regulate cognitive and behavioral symptoms (e.g. Galantamine, benzgalantamine, rivastigmine, and donepezil are cholinesterase). Other FDA-approved drugs like lecanemab and donanemab reduce beta-amyloid plaques in early Alzheimer’s stage to slow the cognitive decline (there’s also some insurance to cover the drug costs).\n",
    "* In moderate to severe cases, memamtine and other medications can be prescribed to regulate glutamate in the brain, reducing Alzheimer’s symptoms to allow patients to be able to do more ordinary tasks, like going to the bathroom independently.\n",
    "    * Dosage of such medications vary based on how well patients tolerate them, starting with low doses and gradually increasing if tolerated. They also have side effects, including nausea, vomiting, confusion, headaches, dizziness, loss of appetite, etc.\n",
    "    * Source: https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-treatment/how-alzheimers-disease-treated\n",

    "    * 1. Preclinical Alzheimer's:\n",
    "        * Stage long before noticeable symptoms, usually only identified in research settings, that can last for many years. Tau proteins (total Tau and phosphorylated Tau) aggregate into tangles within neurons, hindering their functioning, and Beta-amyloid plaques grow between synapses to disturb neuron communication. Patients start taking tests to see signs of Alzheimer’s risk, which include blood sample biomarkers, brain imaging, and genetic tests.\n",
    "    * 2. Mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's:\n",
    "        * Patients start having mild impairments in memory and thinking ability, such as memory lapses during conversation/events and trouble judging or planning tasks. Doesn’t have much effect on work or relationships.\n",
    "    * 3. Mild dementia due to Alzheimer's:\n",
    "        * This is when the patient shows difficulties doing daily tasks due to signs of dementia, mainly bad memory and/or cognitive capacity (possibly some personality changes to be more withdrawn or irritable). Alzheimer’s is likely to be diagnosed at this stage.\n",
    "    * 4. Moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's:\n",
    "        * The patient’s dementia worsens, amplifying the prior symptoms and calling for the need of a care person to help the patient do some daily activities. They also keep growing more irritable and unnecessarily suspicious about close ones.\n",
    "    * 5. Severe dementia due to Alzheimer's: \n",
    "        * Patient starts losing the ability to communicate and execute regular physical activities like walking, sitting, and eventually swallowing and bowel functioning.\n",
    "### Continuum of care providers\n",
    "* 1. Early Stage\n",
    "    * For the Alzheimer’s patients in America, continuum of care starts with the diagnosis. The supportive care team usually includes a primary care physician or specialist, to provide medical & symptom knowledge and management, as well as a social worker from a nonprofit organization or community service, to assist in Alzheimer’s guidance, resources, and coping for the family.\n",
    "        * Specialists may include neurologists (oversee disorders in brain and nervous system), geriatricians (cares for older adults), geriatric psychiatrists (gives mental and emotional health care for older adults), neuropsychologists (specializes in standardized assessment of cognition and behavior, verbatim from gov source), speech and physical therapists (helps improve patients’ communication and activity abilities)\n",
    "* 2. Mid Stage\n",
    "    * The Alzheimer’s symptoms start progressing, so patients start needing outside help for their everyday activities. Although family members may play the caregivers for the patients, other hired care services like visiting nurses and home health aides can assist in tasks like toileting, dressing, bathing, shopping, cooking, and light housekeeping for the Alzheimer’s patients. Caring family members may also hire short-term respite care to temporarily support the patients while the primary caregivers take a break (alzoc).Caregivers can also consider sending patients to Adult Day Care, which offers supervised physical and social activities as medical treatment and therapeutic recreation.\n",
    "* 3. Late Stage\n",
    "    * By this phase, the symptoms of the Alzheimer's patient may make them no longer able to stay at home safely due to difficulty swallowing or other dementia-induced accidents. The supportive care team and/or close family members may transition the patient to hospice (end-of-life) care, nursing home, or other long-term residential facility to provide them 24/7 medical care and supervision.\n",

    "### Biological mechanisms (anatomy, organ physiology, cell & molecular physiology)\n",
    "* Alzheimer’s is a disease targeting the brain, namely its neuron cells that are key to its functionality. Neurons work through communication: a neuron receives cellular signals, in the form of neurotransmitter chemicals sent by other neurons binding to the receptors within the branch-like dendrites of the said neuron, that causes it to send an electric charge down through its cable-like axon neck and send out more neurotransmitters to signal other neurons in the in-between space, called synapses. This communication among millions of neurons, with the aid of consistent glucose sustenance, astrocyte and microglia support, and brain usage, eventually results in humans’ everyday cognitive abilities.\n",
    "* Alzheimer’s disease has multiple observed brain changes that may lead up to and cause the condition, such as…\n",
    "    * Beta-amyloid plaques: beta-amyloid is a protein that clumps in the brain around neurons, namely in-between neuron synapses that interferes with their cellular communication. Too much of these plaques, especially with beta-amyloid 42 form, can greatly hinder neuron functionality and cause cognitive decline.\n",
    "    * Tau tangles: tau is another protein that usually stabilizes microtubules in healthy neurons. In Alzheimer’s patients though, tau detaches from the microtubules and groups together to form neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons, perhaps spurred by overaccumulation of beta-amyloid plaques. These tangles then harm neurons by blocking their transport and communication systems from within.\n",
    "    * Connection Loss and Dysfunction: As neurons stop functioning properly, neuron connections and networks start falling apart, causing brain regions to shrink and cognitive ability to decline.\n",
    "    * Chronic Inflammation: initially-helpful glial cells that begin malfunctioning may induce inflammation in the brain due to lack of debris disposal and management.\n",
    "    * Vascular Issues: since the brain relies heavily on blood and the glucose it provides to keep neurons healthy and active, cardiovascular issues hindering that blood glucose supply may lead to brain inflammation and later neural connection breakdowns.\n",
